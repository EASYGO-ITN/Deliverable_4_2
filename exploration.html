<p>Suggested definition of geothermal exploration(Mahmoud):
Geothermal exploration is the process of searching for and identifying areas of the Earth’s crust that have the potential to host geothermal energy resources. It involves a comprehensive assessment of the geological and geophysical properties of the target area, including rock and fluid properties, temperature and pressure gradients, and the location and extent of heat sources. Geophysical surveys, such as gravity, magnetic, and electrical resistivity surveys, are used to gather more detailed information about the subsurface, and exploratory drilling is used to confirm the presence of geothermal resources and evaluate their feasibility for development.</p>
<p>Geophysical exploration is the process of studying the subsurface of the Earth to locate areas that are likely to have high levels of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy production is possible in areas where the Earth’s crust is relatively thin, allowing heat from the Earth’s interior to be easily accessed. Some areas that are ideal for geothermal energy production include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Volcanic regions: Regions with active or dormant volcanoes are often good sites for geothermal energy production, as they have high levels of heat flow and permeable rock layers.</p></li>
<li><p>Rift zones: Areas where the Earth’s crust is being pulled apart, such as along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or the East African Rift, can provide access to hot rocks and geothermal reservoirs.</p></li>
<li><p>Hot springs and geysers: These natural features indicate the presence of geothermal reservoirs close to the Earth’s surface, which can be used for geothermal energy production.</p></li>
<li><p>Subduction zones: These are areas where tectonic plates are colliding, and one plate is being forced beneath another. This process can cause magma to rise to the surface and create hotspots for geothermal energy production.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We use geologic evidence from the surface and analyze rock samples to understand the formation of these different zones. Once geophysicists have sufficient information about the geology, they proceed to use geophysical instruments to explore the specific location.</p>

<!-- - Make analog to medical x-rays
- Talk about acquisition (include pictures)
PICTURES: MRT/CT scanner / Acquisition picture? -->
<p>In geothermal exploration, our targets are usually located kilometres underground. Thus, direct exploration, as drilling exploratory wells, comes with a high cost and only give good information in the vicinity of the borehole. This makes techniques that can image the underground from the surface highly attractive.</p>
<p>Techniques for this application have been used for a long time, for example in medical imaging. For getting an image of the internal structure of the body without cutting it open, we use physical phenomena, like electro-magnetic waves, acoustical waves, or magnetic fields, to study the reaction of the body to these processes. The physical response of the body itself then gives us information about the internal structure. When getting an x-ray to check for broken bones, we send highly energetic radiation in form of electro-magnetic waves through the body part, which we want to examine. On the other side of the x-ray emitter, a receptor catches the amount of radiation, that has not been absorbed by the body. Since bones absorb a high amount of the radiation, whereas tissue does not, we can locate bones inside the body. Another technique from medical imaging, that is close to the seismic technique used in geothermal exploration, is ultrasound imaging. In ultrasound, we use very small compressions of air, to create an acoustic wave that travels through the body. When the wave hits an obstacle in the tissue, parts of the wave are reflected and are picked up by a receiver. Measuring the time, the wave needs to travel to the obstacle and back and knowing the velocity of the wave in the tissue, we can again locate the obstacle in the body.</p>
<p>Medical applications nowadays allow us to get a very detailed picture of the body from the outside. This is also due to the fact, that we can place sources and receivers for our medical imager in all positions around the body. A prime example for this, are CT and MRT scanners. When imaging the underground, we don’t have this luxurious setting. In geothermal exploration, we usually have way to scarce data, to reconstruct every detail of the underground from measurements. By using very involved processing techniques, we can nevertheless get a very good image of the key features, like big faults in the reservoir. Imaging these faults from the surface allows us to locate fruitful targets to drill into.</p>
<p>The most often used techniques for exploration of geothermal reservoirs are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Seismics: Using waves in form of ground motion, captures information of the subsurfaces where it passes throught. Using seismometers to record the movement at certain station thus gives us insight about the underground.</p></li>
<li><p>Gravity: Rocks of different densities alter the gravitational field of the earth very slightly. Measuring the gravitational field at the surface of the earth allow us to detect areas with dense or less dense material.</p></li>
<li><p>Electromagnetics: Simliar to Seismics, electromagnetic methods use electromagnetic waves travelling in the subsurface. These can be generated by human made sources, but also stem from the solar wind interatting with the earths magnetic field and lightnings.</p></li>

<p>One of the most important methods of imaging the earth are seismic waves. Seismic waves are waves of ground motion, that travel through the earth. Just like in ultrasound, these waves get reflected and refracted at obstacles and boundaries and carry lots of information about the underground structure. The field, that studies seismic waves, is called seismology and has traditionally investigated earthquakes, to understand the science behind earthquakes, learn about the structure of the earth and subsequently protect humankind from natural disasters.</p>
<p>In exploration geophysics, we use the very same phenomena, to image a small, chosen part of the underground, to understand its structure. Since we cannot have earthquakes as a source of seismic waves at the spot, where we want to examine a geothermal site, we must generate seismic waves ourselves. For this, geophysicists use a variety of sources. For shallow experiments, a hammer with a metal plate is enough to generate a wave, that travels tens of meters. If you need the waves to travel deeper into the earth more energy is needed. Therefore, we either use explosives of vibration trucks to create stronger waves. To record the seismic waves, one uses so called geophones instead of seismometers. These consist of a metal pin, that gets firmly inserted into the ground. Attached to the metal pin is an accelerometer, that picks up the ground movement. For a seismic survey, a handful of geophones is laid out on the surface about the reservoir, that we want to image. After installing all the geophones, the sources get placed at different positions at the geothermal site, and at each site, an experiment is conducted. After all experiments at the source locations have been conducted, all the recorded data is collected and passed to a geophysicist for analysis. By analysing all the reflections picked up at the geophones, a detailed image of the underground can be produced.</p>

<p>Apart from seismic methods which are considered more “active” methods, there are other more passive methods that look at different properties of the Earth. They are also useful for other application that need an image of the subsurface.</p>
<section id="gravity-method">
<h5>Gravity method:<a class="headerlink" href="#gravity-method" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>Gravity is the force by which a planet or other body draws objects towards its center. In geophysics, gravity is used to study the distribution of mass in the Earth’s subsurface. A gravity survey involves measuring the gravitational pull of the Earth at various locations on the surface. This changes due to the density or mass of the bodies that are within the Earth. Geophysicist use a device called a gravimeter to make these measurements. By measuring tiny changes in gravitational force, scientists can create maps that show areas where the Earth’s subsurface contains more or less mass. This can help identify features associated to geothermal systems.</p>

<section id="electromagnetic-methods">
<h5>Electromagnetic methods:<a class="headerlink" href="#electromagnetic-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h5>
<p>Electromagnetic (EM) waves are waves of energy that travel through space and can be used to study the Earth’s subsurface. In geophysics, EM methods involve sending EM waves into the ground and measuring their response. EM surveys can be conducted using different frequencies and techniques. When EM waves encounter different types of rocks and minerals in the subsurface, they can induce electrical currents to flow. By measuring these currents, we can create maps that show variations in the subsurface electrical properties. This can help identify areas with different rock types, especially areas that are conductive such as areas of high heat flow. A common method done under this realm of geophysical techniques is the magnetollueric method or MT. This method is used to study the electrical conductivity structure at a much deeper scale. It involves measuring the natural variations in the Earth’s magnetic field and electric field at the Earth’s surface, and using these measurements as the source. By analyzing the frequency-dependent variations in these fields, we can estimate the electrical resistivity of different rock layers and fluids in the subsurface which is of great importance in geothermal exploration.</p>

<p>Exploratory wells are drilled to explore the subsurface geology and determine the presence and characteristics of geothermal reservoirs. They typically involve drilling deep into the earth’s crust to access geothermal fluids, which are hot water or steam that are heated by the earth’s natural heat. The fluids are then pumped to the surface and analyzed for their temperature, pressure, chemistry, and other properties.</p>
<p>One of the main purposes of exploratory wells is to determine the size and potential of a geothermal resource. This information is critical for assessing the feasibility of a geothermal power plant and estimating its potential power output. Exploratory wells can also help to identify the characteristics of a geothermal reservoir, such as its permeability, porosity, and fracture network. This information is important for determining the optimal locations for production wells and designing the well field for a geothermal power plant. By understanding the subsurface geology and fluid flow properties, exploratory wells can help to identify the most productive zones for fluid extraction and ensure efficient and sustainable use of the geothermal resource.</p>
<p>Another important role of exploratory wells is to assess the potential environmental impact of geothermal development. The fluids extracted from exploratory wells are analyzed for their chemistry and potential contaminants, such as heavy metals or gases like carbon dioxide. This information can help to evaluate the potential impact of geothermal development on groundwater quality, surface water, and air quality. In addition, exploratory wells can be used to monitor seismic activity and assess the risk of induced earthquakes associated with geothermal development.</p>
<p>An essential part of exploratory drilling is collecting well logs. These logs are taken using specialized tools that are lowered into the wellbore and record various physical properties of the rock formations encountered during drilling. There are several types of well logs used in the exploration, each providing valuable information about the subsurface geology and rock properties encountered during drilling. Here are some of the most common types of well logs:</p>
<p>Electrical Logs: Electrical logs measure the electrical properties of the rock formations encountered during drilling. The most commonly used electrical logs are the resistivity logs, which measure the resistance of the rock formations to the flow of electrical current. These logs can provide information on the lithology, porosity, and fluid content of the formations.</p>
<p>Acoustic Logs: Acoustic logs measure the time it takes for sound waves to travel through the rock formations, as well as the amplitude and frequency of the waves. These logs can provide information on the lithology, porosity, permeability, and other properties of the formations.</p>
<p>Nuclear Logs: Nuclear logs use radioactive sources to emit gamma rays or neutrons into the rock formations, and measure the radiation that is emitted back. These logs can provide information on the lithology, porosity, and fluid content of the formations.</p>
<p>Imaging Logs: Imaging logs use various techniques to create images of the wellbore and the surrounding rock formations. These logs can provide information on the structure and orientation of the formations, as well as on the presence of fractures and other features.</p>
<p>Other Logs: Other types of well logs include temperature logs, pressure logs, and production logs, which measure various parameters related to temperature, pressure, and fluid flow in the wellbore and surrounding formations.</p>
<p>Overall, the use of multiple types of well logs can provide comprehensive data about the subsurface geology and rock properties. This data is used to construct a detailed image of the subsurface geology and to identify potential geothermal reservoirs. For example, the presence of high porosity and permeability in certain rock formations can indicate the presence of a geothermal reservoir, as these properties are important for the storage and movement of hot fluids.</p>

Another important role of exploratory wells is to assess the potential output of geothermal resources by providing access to subsurface geothermal fluids and rocks. The sampled geothermal fluids and rocks can then be studied via geochemical techniques.</p>

<section id="geochemistry-mahmoud">
<h3>Geochemistry (Mahmoud)<a class="headerlink" href="#geochemistry-mahmoud" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Rock samples obtained from these wells undergo geochemical analysis to understand the composition, mineralogy, and alteration patterns within the reservoir. This information aids in determining the permeability, porosity, and potential mineral reactions within the reservoir, which can influence fluid flow and heat transfer.  Geochemical techniques, such as isotopic analysis, and mineralogical studies, help to assess the feasibility of developing a geothermal resource. These techniques determine the chemical composition of geothermal fluids, including the presence of dissolved gases, minerals, and trace elements to evaluate the potential for mineral scaling and corrosion. Scaling and corrosion can impact the efficiency and longevity of geothermal power plant operations.</p>
<p>Geochemistry ivolves analysis of the fluids extracted for their potential contaminants, such as heavy metals or gases like carbon dioxide. Baseline concentration of these metals and gases is measured, and monitoring is conducted. Deviations caused by geothermal operations can be detected and mitigated. Geochemistry also aids in assessing the potential for induced seismicity. Geothermal energy production usually includes fluid injection into the subsurface, which can affect the stability of faults and trigger earthquakes. Geochemical studies can give insights into the fluid-rock interactions. Overall, geochemisty plays a vital role in understanding and assessing th environemental implications of geothermal operations.

<h3>Geochemistry for exploration (Andrea)<a class="headerlink" href="#geochemistry-for-exploration-andrea" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Geochemistry is the study of the chemical and physical processes that occur in rocks, minerals, and fluids in the Earth’s crust. To find geothermal resources, we use geochemistry to identify areas with high temperatures and to understand the nature of the fluids and rocks underground. We can carry out experiments that include sampling geothermal fluids and laboratory testing. Geothermal fluids are water that is heated by the Earth’s heat and comes up to the surface. By analyzing the chemical and isotopic composition of these fluids, geoscientists can determine the temperature, mineral content, and other properties of the geothermal reservoir. Geochemistry not only includes fluid sampling but gas experiments as well. Sometimes, gases like carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and methane are released from the Earth’s surface, which can provide clues about the geothermal system below. By measuring the type and amount of gases, geoscientists can estimate the temperature and location of the geothermal reservoir.</p>

<p>When investigating a geothermal site, we usually already have a rough idea about the subsurface from a geological model. However, there is often major differences, between our first geological model and reality. By the means of our geophysical survey, we aim to find a model of the underground, such that it matches our recorded data. To verify, that our model is a good fit, we need to be able to simulate our geophysical technique using a computer. This is commonly referred to as forward modelling and would mean to calculate the propagation of seismic waves in the case of a seismic survey. By simulating the wave propagation with respect to our first geological model, we can see, if our recorded data is already close to the one predicted by the simulation. We then try to find model variables, such that the misfit between simulated and recorded data is close to zero.</p>
<p>When minimising an analytic function, we would usually try to find the roots of the derivative as possible candidates for the minima. This gives us the model parameters, where the error between recorded and simulated data is minimal. Since this calculation is way too complex for geophysical techniques, we must use a computer the calculate the derivative. This also means, we don’t get an analytic function for the derivative to find the roots of. Nevertheless, the derivative tells us, how to update the model, such that we reduce the error, by following along into the direction of descent. A little animation for this procedure can be found below. This procedure is commonly called inverse modelling. By repeating the process of calculating the derivative and following along into the direction of descent, one approaches the minimum. This yields a model, that explains our underground structure as good as possible. Once we are done, we hand over our best underground model to the reservoir engineers, to plan the layout of the geothermal power plant.</p>

<h3>Geologic model (&#64;Andrea)<a class="headerlink" href="#geologic-model-andrea" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Geological modelling is a critical component of geothermal exploration. Geothermal resources are often located in complex geological settings, making it essential to create a detailed model of the subsurface geology to identify potential geothermal reservoirs. Once the geophysical inversion has been completed, we use this data to create a geological model of the subsurface. The geological model incorporates data from the geophysical inversion with other geological data such as drill cores, well logs, and surface mapping. Geologists also create models of the different structural features present in the subsurface, such as faults and fractures. These models help to understand the subsurface geology and identify areas where geothermal fluids may accumulate. A wide range of computer software is used to create a 3D model of the subsurface geology which incorporates the different data types, allowing geologists to visualize the subsurface geology in three dimensions. Below is an example of a 3D geologic model of the Utah Forge geothermal test site.</p>
