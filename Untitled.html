<h2>Introduction and Geothermal System Types<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-geothermal-system-types" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Geothermal energy is a renewable energy resource that, in principle, can be tapped almost “anywhere” on Earth. This happens due to the universal increase in temperature with depth that occurs within Earth’s subsurface. <em>If you have heard people say “geothermal energy everywhere and anywhere” this is probably what they meant</em>. This is a unique characteristic of geothermal energy that sets it apart  from other forms of renewable energy such as wind, solar, biofuels, and hydropower, which derive their energy from sources that are found above the Earth’s surface. Hence, the underground exploration and extraction of geothermal energy comes with its own set of technical and economic challenges that make it distinct from other forms of renewable energy.</p>
<p>The potential of geothermal energy is enormous but making an adequate use of it requires specialized knowledge, equipment, and considerable financial investment which has slowed down and restricted its progress. To accelerate the widespread deployment of geothermal energy, numerous technical designs have been proposed over the past century to optimize the use of deep geothermal systems. These technologies vary in terms of their complexity, technological maturity, and commercial success.</p>
<p>The following are the geothermal system types that are currently being actively used or studied for potential commercial use:</p>
<section id="conventional-hydrothermal-systems">
<h3>Conventional hydrothermal systems<a class="headerlink" href="#conventional-hydrothermal-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Conventional hydrothermal systems are unique in that they display what one might consider the most suitable geological characteristics to extract geothermal heat from the subsurface. This means that a conventional hydrothermal system is found when the following combination of factors coincides at depth: a high-temperature aquifer located at relatively shallow depths (less than 4 kilometers), enough pore space filled with water or brine, and a significant in situ permeability <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id44" title="J. Tester, E. Drake, M. Driscoll, M. Golay, and W. Peters. Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options. The MIT Press, 2nd edition edition, 2012.">Tester <em>et al.</em>, 2012</a>]</span>. As a result of these requirements, these reservoirs are limited by geography and are usually located in areas with significant volcanic or magmatic activity. Although hydrothermal resources offer substantial energy potential, their rarity has resulted in that most high-potential resources have already been tapped. This has made it increasingly challenging or expensive to discover and develop new sites.</p>

</figure>
<p>Given that only an arguably rare combination of geological factors give rise to hydrothermal systems, a comprehensive understanding of the geological evolution of subsurface conditions is required. As such, exploration of this type of resources usually includes various geological, geophysical and geochemical techniques. For more information regarding this, please see the <span class="xref myst">Exploration</span> section.</p>
<p>While existing conventional hydrothermal systems continue to produce vast amounts of renewable energy and, although scarce, potential new sites offer enticing opportunities, the growing demand for renewable heat and power calls for the need of alternative geothermal systems!</p>

<h3>Enhanced geothermal systems<a class="headerlink" href="#enhanced-geothermal-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Considering that “the deeper we go, the hotter it gets”, usually temperature is not the restricting variable for geothermal development. Permeability tends to be the most sought-after feature at great depths. When naturally-occurring permeability is not found, one can recurr to other ways of developing a geothermal reservoir.  Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) refer to man-made reservoirs that are created by drilling wells into naturally impermeable rock formations, and then increasing their permeability through hydraulic stimulation techniques such as hydraulic fracturing (opening up new fractures in the rock) and/or hydro-shearing (displacing natural fractures in order to increase their conductivity). By stimulating the reservoir, the goal is to emulate the high productivity characteristics, meaning our ability to obtain high fluid flow rates, of hydrothermal systems. The concept of EGS was first proposed in the early 1970s by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id54">Armstead and Tester, 1987</a>]</span>. Since then, the technical feasibility of EGS has been demonstrated at several research sites worldwide <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id55" title="Katrin Breede, Khatia Dzebisashvili, Xiaolei Liu, and Gioia Falcone.

<p>Some of the challenges that EGS deployment must solve to overcome their techno-economic and environmental challenges are: insufficient fluid flow rate, clogging of the fracture network, preature thermal breakthrough, and induced seismicity <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id55" title="Katrin Breede, Khatia Dzebisashvili, Xiaolei Liu, and Gioia Falcone.

These issues have impacted the cost-competitiveness and public acceptance of EGS which has limited the successful roll-out and overall interest in EGS projects.

Ongoing research and commercial efforts are aimed at improving our understanding and reduce the cost of operating EGS.</p>

<h3>Advanced Geothermal Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-geothermal-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>As you can probably see by now, dealing with rocks that are buried several kilometers underground involves a great deal of uncertainty and complexity. A promising, yet controversial technology called Advanced Geothermal Systems (AGS) has emerged to extract geothermal energy while minimizing direct interaction with the rocks themselves. This is achieved by using a closed-loop system deep underground.</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional hydrothermal or enhanced geothermal systems, where the fluid used to extract energy directly moves through the rock, AGS operates by circulating a fluid through a closed wellbore that is kept separate from the surrounding rock. In AGS, the geological properties of the underground reservoir are therefore less important because the working fluid does not come into direct contact with the rock. AGS technologies being currently tested propose isolating this closed-loop setup either through mechanical means (emplacing a physical barrier between the fluid and rock) or chemically (adding a substance to make the rock impermeable). Like EGS, AGS also harnesses heat from the rock through conduction. However, the thermal performance of AGS largely depends on how many closed wellbores are created (or drilled) at depth. This translates to a very significant need for drilling when implementing AGS systems, which is usually the most expensive component of developing geothermal energy.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="schematic-of-an-advanced-geothermal-system-ags-taken-from-rangel-jurado-et-al-2022">

</figure>
<p>Interestingly, the idea of extracting energy from deep closed-loop geothermal systems was first proposed almost a century ago (Hodgson, 1927), but no commercial system exists as of today. Since very little AGS field data are available yet, it is still unclear if such an underground heat exchanger that requires a great amount of drilling can sustain reasonable thermal output over multiple decades at an affordable cost <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id32" title="Koenraad F.

However,  there has been a recent increase in interest and investment in AGS technology from both industry and academia. This interest has been driven largely by a few startups in North America and Europe that are actively and exclusively working on closed-loop geothermal systems. These startups have gained a lot of traction in the public space because they claim closed-loop systems could significantly boost geothermal energy production on a larger scale while avoiding some of the problems associated with other methods like CHS and EGS, such as induced seismicity, groundwater contamination, and unpredictable interactions between fluids and rocks. For more information regarding this, please see ### Note: Include tag to Issues section.</p>
<p>Ongoing research efforts in AGS aim to improve the understanding of the commercial viability of this technology and address the technical and economic challenges that currently limit its deployment. Some of the research areas include improving the design and operation of closed-loop systems, optimizing drilling technologies, developing novel materials for subsurface heat exchangers, and assessing the environmental and social impacts of AGS projects. With continued research and development that would drive the cost of these systems down, AGS has the potential to become a key contributor to the global transition toward a low-carbon energy future.</p>

<h3>CO2-based geothermal systems<a class="headerlink" href="#co2-based-geothermal-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, extracting geothermal energy has always involved using water or brine as the energy extraction fluid in the deep reservoir, as explained in the geothermal system types above. However, in the past two decades, scientific studies – both theoretical and numerical – have highlighted the potential of using supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> (sCO<sub>2</sub>) instead of water. This is because sCO<sub>2</sub> has unique chemical, transport, and thermodynamic properties that make it an attractive alternative for geothermal energy extraction <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id40" title="Donald W Brown.

<li><p><strong>More energy production:</strong> The excellent transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> theoretically lead to higher energy output from geothermal reservoirs. This is because sCO<sub>2</sub> has better transport properties than water. It moves more easily due to a higher fluid mobility. The fluid mobility (i.e., the ratio between the fluid density and its dynamic viscosity) dictates how easily a fluid can flow through a matrix; and the fluid mobility of CO<sub>2</sub> is much higher than that of water, for equivalent pressure and temperature conditions. This is extremely important, both from a heat generation or electric power production perspective, because the higher the flow rate, the higher the energy production output.</p>
<p>Note: A noteworthy limitation of replacing water with CO<sub>2</sub> is that the former has much better specific thermal properties than the latter. In simpler terms, if you had 1 kilogram of water and 1 kilogram of sCO<sub>2</sub>, the water would be better at moving heat around. Nonetheless, this tradeoff can easily be overcome considering that CO<sub>2</sub> allows for much larger flow rates (i.e., many more kilograms per second coming out of the production well).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reduced chemical reactivity:</strong> CO<sub>2</sub> is not a powerful solvent for inorganic materials. This means that CO<sub>2</sub> is not expected to significantly react with and dissolve the rock-forming minerals at depth, thus avoiding issues related to mineral scaling (for more details about this, please see the <span class="xref myst">Issues</span> section). Using CO<sub>2</sub> as the subsurface working fluid can therefore extend the lifespan of the wells, reduce maintenance costs, and improve the system’s reliability.</p></li>

<p>CO<sub>2</sub>-based geothermal energy is still at a research and development stage as well. Some additional technical and environmental challenges that are being looked into include: the need for specialized materials and equipment, an overlap of a CO<sub>2</sub> source relatively close to the geothermal reservoir, the risk of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage through the subsurface, among others. Research in this field is ongoing, with the aim of getting sCO<sub>2</sub>-based geothermal systems ready for commercial use in the near future.</p>

<p>Once a geothermal target has been identified, an adequate development strategy is of paramount importance. Reservoir simulation is a great tool to estimate how much energy, whether this is thermal or electric energy, we can get out of a given reservoir.</p>
<p>Reservoir simulation is a calculation that is performed on a computer by solving a set of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) utilizing a certain computer program, such as Python, C, etc., for mimicking and understanding the behavior of a reservoir system. These PDEs describe physical and chemical processes within the reservoir system, related to mass transport, heat transport, momentum transport, and reactive transport (Kolditz et al., 2012). Here, we recognize four fundamental processes that might happen within the reservoir system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Thermal process (T): it describes propagation of thermal energy by conduction, convection, and advection</p></li>
<li><p>Hydraulic process (H): it describes fluid movement in the porous and/or fractured systems, following Darcy’s law</p></li>
<li><p>Mechanical process (M): it describes solid deformation due to changes in pore pressure, thermal stress, and tectonic influences</p></li>
<li><p>Chemical process (C): it describes chemical reaction between fluid and solid surface under certain pressure and temperature</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In nature, these fundamental processes always occur at the same time, leading to coupled/multi-physics simulation condition, e.g. thermo-hydro (TH) simulations, etc. The main ingredients to conduct reservoir simulation are 1) meshed geological model, 2) measurement data, and 3) PDE solver, contained in softwares such as TOUGH2, CMG, etc.</p>
<p>The main interest in many reservoir simulation is to know the production capacity of a reservoir system. Therefore, introducing producers and/or injectors is of interest to evaluate the amount of heat that can be produced. The most commonly considered  injection-production patterns for geothermal reservoir development are doublet and five-spot pattern (Grant and Bixley, 2011).</p>
<section id="doublet-pattern">
<h2>Doublet pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#doublet-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Doublet pattern is a configuration consisting of a producer and an injector separated over a certain distance. It is the most commonly used pattern for geothermal energy extraction. Within the simulation, the setup is to inject cold water through injector and produce heated cold-water through producer. Here, we are interested in monitoring the advancement of cold water front. A fast arrival of cold water front at producer will cause cooling at the producer, hence, reduce the thermal output of the system.</p>
</section>
<section id="five-spot-pattern">
<h2>Five-spot pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#five-spot-pattern" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Five-spot pattern is a configuration consisting of a producer with four injectors separated over a certain distance where the injectors encircle the producer. Here, the injection-production setup for the simulation is the same as in doublet pattern. The interest is to monitor the cold water front to avoid its fast arrival at producer.</p>
<p><img alt="Probabilistic simulation for addressing uncertainties, figure taken from optiy.eu" src="_images/ressim_2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Since the amount of measurement data is often limited, it is critical to account uncertainties within our simulations. It is to estimate risk in any operations. The uncertainty quantification is always performed with probabilistic framework which demands numerous model runs. It is computationally expensive. An option to reduce this computational load is to use machine learning to accelerate the model run.</p>
<p>Machine learning provides a low-dimensional representation from parameters to any quantity of interest. However, we need to carefully use and deploy this machine learning technique by including physics during its training. It is to improve its intepretability and reliability.</p>

<p>In geothermal power generation, the efficient extraction of steam from underground reservoirs is crucial for maximizing energy production. Geothermal steam is primarily obtained through production wells drilled into high-temperature reservoirs. However, during the extraction process, a significant amount of heat is lost from the steam due to various mechanisms. Understanding and minimizing this heat loss effect is essential for optimizing the overall efficiency of geothermal power plants.</p>
<section id="heat-loss-mechanisms">
<h2>Heat Loss Mechanisms:<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-loss-mechanisms" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the heat loss mechanisms is crucial for optimizing geothermal energy extraction and minimizing energy losses. The primary heat loss mechanisms in geothermal steam production wells include conduction, convection, radiation, and heat exchange with the surrounding formation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Conduction:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid medium. In the context of geothermal wells, heat loss through conduction occurs primarily through the well casing and the surrounding rock formations. The casing material, typically made of steel, has a finite thermal conductivity. As the hot geothermal steam flows through the wellbore, heat is conducted through the casing walls, resulting in heat loss to the environment. Similarly, heat can be conducted from the steam into the cooler surrounding formations, leading to a decrease in steam temperature.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Convection:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Convection is the transfer of heat through the movement of fluids. In geothermal steam production wells, convection heat loss occurs when the rising steam comes into contact with cooler fluids or rock formations along the wellbore. This contact causes heat transfer from the steam to the surrounding medium, resulting in a reduction in steam temperature. Convection can also occur within the well itself, as fluid circulation patterns can lead to the mixing of hot and cooler fluids, further contributing to heat loss.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Radiation:</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Radiation is the transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves. In the case of geothermal steam production wells, radiation heat loss occurs as the steam interacts with the wellbore and the surrounding environment. The steam emits infrared radiation, which can escape through the wellbore and be absorbed by the surrounding formations or the atmosphere. This process leads to a loss of thermal energy from the steam, reducing its temperature.</p>
<p>These heat loss mechanisms have a significant impact on the overall efficiency and productivity of geothermal steam production wells. The loss of heat from the steam results in a decrease in steam temperature, which affects the efficiency of power generation. Lower-temperature steam requires additional energy input for conversion into electricity, resulting in reduced power output and decreased overall plant efficiency.<span class="xref myst">Tester, J. W., et al. (2006).</span></p>

<section id="insulation">
<h3><em>Insulation</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#insulation" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Applying insulation materials around the well casing can help reduce heat loss through conduction. Insulating materials with low thermal conductivity, such as fiberglass or ceramic fiber, can be installed to minimize heat transfer from the steam to the surrounding wellbore. Additionally, insulating the surface pipelines that transport the steam can prevent heat loss during transportation.</p>
</section>
<section id="wellbore-integrity">
<h3><em>Wellbore Integrity</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#wellbore-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Ensuring the integrity of the wellbore is essential for minimizing heat loss. Proper cementing techniques and wellbore construction can help create a barrier between the steam and the surrounding formations, reducing heat transfer through conduction and convection.</p>
</section>
<section id="downhole-heat-exchangers">
<h3><em>Downhole Heat Exchangers</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#downhole-heat-exchangers" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Implementing downhole heat exchangers can recover some of the lost heat. These devices allow for the transfer of heat from the geothermal steam to a working fluid, which can be utilized for power generation or other applications. By capturing and utilizing the heat that would otherwise be lost, the overall efficiency of the geothermal system is improved.</p>
</section>
<section id="advanced-well-design">
<h3><em>Advanced Well Design</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-well-design" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Optimized well designs, such as double-casing systems or thermal liners, can minimize heat loss by reducing the contact between the steam and cooler surroundings. These designs create a thermal barrier that improves the retention of thermal energy in the steam and reduces heat transfer.</p>
</section>
<section id="steam-separator-and-re-injection">
<h3><em>Steam Separator and Re-injection</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#steam-separator-and-re-injection" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Installing steam separators at the wellhead can help separate any non-condensable gases from the steam. These gases have a lower heat content and can be re-injected back into the reservoir, reducing the loss of valuable thermal energy.</p>
</section>
<section id="surface-heat-recovery">
<h3><em>Surface Heat Recovery</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#surface-heat-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Implementing heat recovery systems at the surface can capture waste heat from the geothermal steam. This recovered heat can be utilized for various purposes, such as space heating, industrial processes, or district heating, further improving the overall energy efficiency of the geothermal system.</p>
</section>
<section id="monitoring-and-optimization">
<h3><em>Monitoring and Optimization</em>:<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-and-optimization" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Regular monitoring and optimization of the geothermal system can help identify and address any heat loss issues promptly. This includes monitoring well performance, steam quality, and temperature profiles to ensure efficient steam production and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the heat loss effect in geothermal steam production wells poses a significant challenge to efficient power generation. It is a critical factor that influences the efficiency and productivity of geothermal power plants. Understanding the mechanisms and implementing effective mitigation strategies can help maximize energy extraction, improve power generation efficiency, and extend the lifespan of geothermal reservoirs. It is worth noting that the specific mitigation strategies employed may vary depending on the geological characteristics of the geothermal resource, the well design, and the available technologies. Therefore, it is important to consider site-specific factors and consult with geothermal experts and engineers to implement the most suitable mitigation measures for a particular geothermal steam production well.</p>
