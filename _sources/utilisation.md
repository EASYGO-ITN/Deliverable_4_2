# Geothermal Energy Utilisation

This is a test {cite}`perez2011python`.

## Introduction @Tristan
From the geothermal reservoir we can produce hot fluids carrying plenty of thermal energy. This thermal energy can be
used to heat homes, offices and even greenhouses, which is particularly attractive in cold climates, where heating 
represents a large portion of the total energy consumption.

Where there is no demand for heating, for example in hot climates or during the summer months in cold climates, or
where there is no consumer in the vicintiy of the geothermal reservoir, the thermal energy can also be converted to
other forms of energy such as electricity. This can be transported more easily over long distances to the consumers.

## Role of Geothermal Energy @Lorenzo
* depends where you are
* Iceland is driven by geothermal but in a unique position
* multipurpose tool - Munich area 

## Direct Use

### District Heating @Phil?

### Heat Pumps @Arianna?

## Energy Conversion @Tristan
Converting from one form of energy to another is always associated with losses. The most familiar type of such losses 
in our everyday life are frictional losses. For example an electric car converts electric potential energy into kinetic 
energy, but the friction between the wheels and the road surface eventually brings the vehicle to a stand still once 
the car's battery is empty. These kind of frictional losses are broadly described as mechanical losses.

Besides the aforementioned mechanical losses, conversion of thermal energy into more useful forms of energy like 
mechanical energy (in turn this can easily be converted into rotational and then electrical potential energy via use of
a turbine and generator). This is because the conversion is an irreversible process.

A process is reversible if it takes but a small nudge to reverse the process, however when it take a significant effort 
to reverse a process it is considered irreversible. Cooking is a great example of irreversible processes; it is simple 
enough to fry some fish, but is it significantly more difficult to unfry the fish and return it to its original state.

There are a number of processes for converting thermal energy to mechanical energy, these are often referred to as heat
engines or power cycles.

### Carnot Cycle

Definitions:
A thermal reservoir is a body at a constant temperature. No adding of thermal energy will change its temperature. For 
example, adding a pot of boiling water to a lake will not measurably change the lake's average temperature.

The Carnot Cycle converts the heat flow between two differently tempered thermal reservoirs into work (mechanical energy).
The Carnot Cycle is the simplest, most efficient, but merely theoretical heat engine.

1. The initial state
2. The boundary to the hot reservoir is opened to allow heat transfer. Then the system is slowly (reversibly) expanded,
with the heat transfer from the hot reservoir maintaining it at a constant temperature
3. The boundary to the hot reservoir is then closed isolating the cell. The fluid is then expanded until its temperature
drops to that of the cold reservoir
4. The boundary to the cold reservoir is opened to allow heat transfer. The fluid is then reversibly compressed,with
heat transfer into the cold reservoir maintaining the fluid's temperature constant
5. The boundary to the cold reservoir is then closed, isolating the cell. The fluid is then compressed until the 
temperature reaches that of the hot reservoir.
6. Repeat from 2.

Insert some diagrams

* something about net power and efficiency
* how one could realise the various stages of the cycle
  * isothermal heat addition with expansion - pure fluid phase change (from liquid to vapour)
  * isentropic expansion - use a turbine, but liquid might drop out....
  * isothermal heat removal with compression - pure fluid phase change (from vapour to liquid)
  * ientropic compression - pump or compressor, but they dont like vapour/liquid respectively

### Rankine Cylce
1. Compress a fluid to a higher pressure - e.g. using pump
2. Use a heat source to heat and evaporate the fluid
3. Use a turbine to expand the hot fluid to the starting pressure
4. Use a heat sink to cool and condense the fluid to the starting pressure
5. Repeat from 1.

Insert diagram(s)

## Power Plants

### Dry Steam @Tristan
* Geofluid arrives as vapour is the easiest to handle because we can directly use it to drive a turbine
* Link back to Rankine Cycle (reservoir is heat introduction)

### Flash @Tristan
* Geofluid is a mixture of liquid and vapour
* only vapour portion can be utilised as liquid is incompressible
* flash temperature optimisation

### Binary @Lorenzo
* low temperatures/vapour content
* transfer heat to secondary fluid, which undergoes a classical rankine cycle
