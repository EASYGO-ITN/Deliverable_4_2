# Geothermal Energy Utilisation

## Introduction @Tristan
From the geothermal reservoir we can produce hot fluids carrying plenty of thermal energy. This thermal energy can be
used to heat homes, offices and even greenhouses, which is particularly attractive in cold climates, where heating 
represents a large portion of the total energy consumption.

Where there is no demand for heating, for example in hot climates or during the summer months in cold climates, or
where there is no consumer in the vicintiy of the geothermal reservoir, the thermal energy can also be converted to
other forms of energy such as electricity. This can be transported more easily over long distances to the consumers.

## Direct Use @Wen
The versatile direct utilisations of geothermal fluids with a temperature between 10 &deg;C - 150 &deg;C {cite}`anderson1979direct` has been ducomented for over 2000 years {cite}`direct-2000`. By the end of 2019, the total annual energy consumption from direct geothermal use is 283,580 GW h worldwide, reported in 88 countries and/or regions {cite}`lund2021direct`.The figure [data from {cite}`lund2021direct`] below shows main categories of direct utilisations of geothermal energy, dominated by heat pumps, bathing & swimming, and space heating.

### Geothermal Heat Pumps

So far, geothermal heat pumps (GHPs), also called ground-source heat pumps, have been the most popular way to directly utilise geo-fluids since its first use in 1850s in Austria {cite}`heatflux1`.  GHPs take advantages of the fact that a few feet below Earth's surface, the temperatue of the ground remains relatively constant, ranging from 7 &deg;C - 25 &deg;C {cite}`DOE:2023`. In the winter, the ground is warmer than the air above it while, in the summer, colder. GHPs then acts like a refrigerator, transferring heat through geo-fluids for building heating, ventilation and air conditioning {cite}`heatflux1`.

### Space Heating
Space heating, including individual space heating and district heating, dates back from 14th century when inhabitants of French village, Chaudes-Aigues Cnatal, utilised geothermal heat via a district heating networks that is still in use today {cite}`stanford`. Wells or multiple wells, consisting of producer and injector, are used to circulate geo-fluids with a temperature ranging from 60 &deg;C - 90 &deg;C {cite}`spaceheating`. If high enough temperature can be reached at a depth of 20 m - 200 m,, downhole exchangers can also be used. The leading countries in space heating are China, Iceland and Turkey, with a worldwide installed capacity reaching 12768 MWt by the end of 2019 {cite}`lund2021direct`.

## Power Plants
Geothermal power plants convert the thermal energy extracted from the sub-surface into electricity. The working 
principle behind converting the thermal energy to mechanical work (i.e. rotational energy) is not too different from 
other power plants types like coal-fired or nuclear plants.

### Working Principle: The Rankine Cycle
The Rankine Cyle is a heat engine, that converts thermal energy into mechanical work, which in turn can be used for 
driving a turbine. It is based on the theoretical Carnot Cycle, with adaptations to make the expansion and compression 
stages easier to implement with existing turbomachinery (i.e. turbines, pumps and compressors, see below).


![Rankine Cycle](Utilisation_pictures/RankineCycle.svg)

* **Initial State**: The cycle working fluid (e.g. water) is at a low pressure and saturated liquid state
*  **Stage 1**: A pump is used to compress and pressurise the working fluid to a high pressure
* **Stage 2**: Heat is added to the fluid at constant pressure, raising its temperature until it reaches the boiling point. From hereon, heat addition results in subsequent vaporisation of the working fluid until it is fully vapourised.
* **Stage 3**: The high pressure vapour is expanded in a turbine, which converts the fluid's thermal energy into rotational energy, and in turn drives a generator to produce electricity.
* **Stage 4**: The expanded low pressure vapour is cooled at constant pressure until it reaches its condensation point. From hereon, removal of heat results of subsequent condensation of the working fluid vapour until it is fully liquefied. This returns the fluid to its initial state and closes the cycle. 
* Repeat from **Stage 1**

Depending on the temperature and physical state (i.e. vapour, liquid or a mixture of the two) of the geofluid arriving
at surface, different types of geothermal power plants are:

### Dry Steam @Tristan
Dry Steam power plants operate on the hottest geothermal resources, where the geofluid arrives at the surface as steam
at temperatures as high as 250 &deg;C.

![Dry Steam](Utilisation_pictures/DrySteamPlant.svg)

* **Initial State**: High-pressure saturated steam arrives at the power plant
*  **Stage 1**: The hot vapour is expanded in a turbine
* **Stage 2**: The low-pressure vapour is condensed (e.g. using a cooling tower)
* **Stage 3**: The low-pressure liquid is re-pressurised using a pump and re-injected into the reservoir

There are some peculiarities compared to the Rankine Cycle we discussed earlier:
* The stages do not close the loop - this is because the heating and re-boiling actually takes place in the geothermal reservoir and this not usually included in the diagram
* The cooling tower "loses" a considerable amount of geofluid - the typical white clouds over a power station 

This is also the reason why they are typically referred as being ***open-loop*** 

### Flash @Tristan
Flash power plants operate on geothermal resources, where the geofluid arrives at surface as a steam-water mixture.

![Flash Plant](Utilisation_pictures/FlashPlant.svg)

* **Initial State**: Hot high-pressure two-phase geofluid arrives at the power plant 
*  **Stage 1**: The geofluid is "flashed" (i.e. reducing its pressure). This causes the fluid to partition into a liquid and vapour phase, see dashed lines.

`````{admonition} Optimising Power Production
:class: tip
Flashing the geofluid more, can produce more steam (good) but comes at the cost of lower specific power generated by the turbine (bad) so there is a trade-off.

`````

*  **Stage 2**: The hot and high-pressure vapour is exanded in a turbine
*  **Stage 3**: The low-pressure vapour is condensed (e.g. using a Cooling Tower)
*  **Stage 4**: The low pressure liquid is re-pressurised using a pump and re-injected into the reservoir alongside the liquid obtained from Stage 1

There are some peculiarities compared to the Rankine Cycle we discussed earlier:
* The stages do not close the loop - this is because the heating and re-boiling actually takes place in the geothermal reservoir and this not usually included in the diagram
* The cooling tower "loses" a considerable amount of geofluid - the typical white clouds over a power station 

### Binary @Lorenzo

Historically speaking, the first geothermal resources that were exploited are those providing brine at high temperatures, perhaps even in vapor state, as it is the case of Larderello in Italy. On the contrary, extracting energy from brines at lower temperatures is more challenging and the classical dry steam or flash power plant might not be profitable. In this case, the usual approach to first use the geothermal brine to heat another more suitable fluid, and have this secondary fluid undergo a rankine cycle. The cooled down brine is subsequently reinjected into the ground. This is the concept of Binary Geothermal Power Plant. 

The standard rankine cycle for geothermal applications is called Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC): this is because the fluid flowing inside the machinery (pump, heat exchangers, turbine) is usually an hydrocarbon, whose properties are selected to maximize the efficiency of the power plant. In particular, the boiling point is much lower than that of compressed water, allowing the generation of the vapor that drives the turbine without any need of a flashing procedure. 


## Power Plant Equipment @Lorenzo
All the geothermal power plants convert the thermal energy into electricity by using several different machinery. In particular, the most recurring component is the turbine: its scope is to extract the energy of the vapor and convert it into mechanical energy.

A typical axial turbine for binary geothermal power plants is shown below: at its simplest, it is composed of a shaft driven by a series of wing-like elements, called blades. The blades are radially disposed around the shaft. By blowing the hot vapor on the blades, each one of them will generate some lift, and their combination will induce the rotation of the turbine.

![Turboden Axial Turbine](../GeothermalEnergy/Utilisation_pictures/axialturbine.png)

The heat exchangers come in different models and are responsible for several different thermodynamic transformations. In the binary power plants, we can usually distinguish between two different types: the shell and tube heat exchangers and the fin and tube heat exchangers .

The first ones can be used when there is little fluid in gaseous phase contributing to the heat exchange process: their typical application is in the evaporator of the binary power plant, which is responsible of transferring heat from the geothermal brine to the working fluid undergoing the rankine cycle. here, usually two different shell and tube heat exchangers are used: one to preheat the fluid and bring it on the verge of evaporation, and the other to promote the evaporation and eventually provide vapor to the turbine. Despite being of the same typology, they work in quite a different way.
