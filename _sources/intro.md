# Welcome to Geothermal Energy

As the global quest for decarbonization is underway, geothermal energy is poised to play a pivotal role in the 
renewable energy transition of many countries worldwide. To harness its full potential, there is a pressing need for 
experts with a broad and profound understanding of geothermal systems â€“ experts who can operate these systems safely 
and efficiently.

The [EASYGO-ITN](https://easygo-itn.eu/) was created to train the next generation of geothermal experts in the 
efficient and safe operation of geothermal resources through through a multi-disciplinary approach combining geology, 
geophysics, geochemistry, advanced modelling, process engineering, and many more... 

As part of our efforts to raise awareness and a deeper understanding of geothermal energy, we have developed a 
comprehensive wiki on geothermal energy. Here, you can learn more about one of Earth's most promising, potent, and 
sustainable energy sources! Join us as we embark on this transformative journey!
