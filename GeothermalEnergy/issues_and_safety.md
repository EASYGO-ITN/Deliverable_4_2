# Issues and Safety of Geothermal Operations

During production of geothermal fluids, the change in pressure and temperature is unavoidable. It in its turn results in the change in fluid composition and properties. Depending on the initial properties of the fluid, these changes can significantly affect operation of the geothermal system and should, therefore, be carefully monitored. In the following paragraphs we explain the processes, happening at different stages of production and consequent injection of geothermal fluids.

## Scaling
As we already said, pressure and temperature go down as we extract geothermal fluid to the surface. This may lead to one of the major issues - scaling. As temperature drops and gases exsolve from the fluid, solubility of the minerals initially contained in the fluid also drops. It is mainly controlled by the saturation index (SI) and when SI > 0, mineral is considered over-saturated and can precipitate out of the solution. What this means to us, is that there is a risk of scaling in the production tubings, heat exchanger and other surface facilities. Scaling leads to the decreased tubes diameter and, consequently, lower productivity. It can also promote corrosion of metal surfaces and compromise the system. 

## Corrosion

One of the major reasons for corrosion is contact of the geothermal fluid with oxygen at the different stages of operation, which leads to oxidation of ions, iron in particular. It has been observed that concentration of these oxidized ions increases as fluid passes from the production to the injection site (REF).

## Control and prevention

Various methods to control scaling and corrosion exist and are constantly being developed. One of the most common is usage of chemicals - scaling or corrosion inhibitors to prevent or, at least, slow down these processes.
Additionally, to decrease scaling, increased pressure at the surface can be applied to keep gas in the dissolved state. 
Development of chemical models to accurately predict system's behavior is another big research topic, receiving attention.


# Processes during reinjection

Reinjection of the produced geothermal fluid back into the reservoir is a common practice, widely applied at fields around the world (REF). There is a number of reasons for using this technology (REF):

* Produced water disposal due to environmental reasons and regulations;
* Recharge of the reservoir/aquifer;
* Pressure compensation to account for fluid extraction and to prevent subsidence;
* Enhancement of thermal extraction from over- and underlying formations.

So, geothermal fluid reinjection has clear economical and technical advantages and is a key, and sometimes mandatory, process in a geothermal project. Therefore, its efficiency is very important and possible issues are constantly monitored to prevent them. Success of this process could be influenced by various processes during operations. Disturbances in temperature, pressure, stresses and compositions in geothermal reservoirs as a result of reinjection could trigger complex coupled processes that influence injectivity. Later we discuss these processes individually in more detail.

## Cooling of the reservoir (@Joss)

As we said before, the water injected into the geothermal reservoir has a lower temperature than that of the reservoir itself. As a result, heat flows from the rock towards the fluid, causing the temperature of the production well water to be higher than that of the injected water. However, in a closed geothermal reservoir, the extracted heat cannot be replenished, and the total amount of heat available for extraction is finite. This can be likened to the depletion of a water tank as water is pumped out; similarly, the extraction of heat leads to a reduction in the total amount of heat available, which in turn affects the reservoir's temperature.
The reduction in temperature caused by the pumping of water has a direct impact on the productivity of the reservoir. As the temperature decreases, the economic viability of further exploitation also declines. Additionally, the temperature changes can trigger faults located in the cooling regime of the reservoir.

## Injectivity decline (@Anna)

One key issue that determines the success of reinjection, thus of the whole geothermal project, is to achieve and maintain injectivity at acceptable level. In many geothermal fields where reinjection has been applied, continuous decreases in injectivity have been recorded (REF). In other words, as the time goes we are able to inject less and less fluid because of some blockages. In some extreme cases, poor injectivity performance has led to the shutdown of the whole geothermal project, such as the Klaipeda geothermal plant in Lithuania (REF).

Based on the primary mechanisms, the clogging processes can be divided into three groups: a) physical processes, related to migration of particles; b) chemical processes, caused by chemical reactions; c) biological processes as a result of bacterial activity.

As you can see from the schematic, sources of clogging occur all the way along the fluid path. 
- From the start of production fluid can carry small particles, produced, for example, from poorly-consolidated sandstones. 
- As the fluid moves up, its pressure and temperature decreases, minerals saturation decreases and scaling can occur.
- After heat extraction, despite complex filtration systems, some fines are still left in the fluid volume and can migrate further into the reservoir. Corrosion also can occur at this stage if the system is not isolated.
- When the cold fluid is injected back into the reservoir, multiple processes can happen:
  - Not-filtered fines can block the pores;
  - Changes in the chemical composition can result in dissolution or precipitation of minerals in the pore space;
  - Changes in fluid salinity or pH can initiate migration of internal fines or swelling of clays;
  - Contamination of water as well as change of the temperature can promote bacterial activity, resulting in production of bio-polymers and pore space reduction.

So, you can see that at the end of this chain multiple processes can result in the reduction of rock porosity and permeability, which can seriously affect the whole process. There are various remediation methods for each of the described issues, however prediction of these processes is crucial for successul prevention.

## Thermal fracturing at the well and hydro-shearing (@Joss)

The injection of fluids into a reservoir can cause significant changes in temperature, which may lead to the opening or reopening of fractures. This thermal crack initiation and propagation can alter the injectivity and permeability of the well, ultimately affecting the economic viability of the reservoir. Additionally, the energy released by these thermal cracks may result in induced seismicity.
It is important to note that excessive permeability can cause the reservoir to cool too quickly, which can negatively impact its long-term profitability. On the other hand, insufficient permeability can result in poor fluid exchange, leading to suboptimal economic performance.
In crystalline reservoirs, such as granite, fluid flow occurs primarily through fractures. To improve fracture permeability, a stimulation technique involving the injection of water at high pressure is employed. This process causes the fracture to slide and dilate, thereby creating a larger flow channel and improving the flow and heat exchange in the reservoir.
