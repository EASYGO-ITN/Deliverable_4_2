# Issues and Safety of Geothermal Operations

While geothermal energy offers many benefits as a renewable and sustainable energy source, there are some potential risks and drawbacks associated with its use. During the production of geothermal fluids, the change in pressure and temperature is unavoidable. It, in turn, results in a change in fluid composition and properties. Depending on the initial properties of the fluid, these changes can significantly affect the operation of the geothermal system and should, therefore, be carefully monitored. In the following section, we explain the environmental and operational risks/issues happening at different stages of production and the consequent injection of geothermal fluids.

`````{admonition} Recap on how geothermal energy works
:class: tip
Geothermal power plants harness the heat stored beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity. This heat comes from hot water or steam found in underground reservoirs. To access this heat, operators drill (deep) wells into the Earth to extract the hot fluids. After the heat is extracted and used to generate electricity, the cooled fluids are often reinjected into the reservoir to maintain pressure and sustain the resource.

## Environmental Impacts of Geothermal Operations

Geothermal energy is often considered an environmentally friendly energy source due to its low greenhouse gas emissions and renewability. However, it is essential to consider the potential environmental impacts associated with geothermal operations to ensure sustainable development and minimize adverse effects on the surrounding ecosystem. This section will discuss some critical environmental concerns related to geothermal energy production, including greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and induced seismicity.

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Geothermal power plants emit fewer greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuel-based power plants. However, they do release some greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), during the extraction of geothermal fluids. Geothermal plants emit about 5% of the carbon dioxide, 1% of the sulfur dioxide, and less than 1% of the nitrous oxide emitted by a coal-fired plant of equal size, and certain types of geothermal plants produce near-zero emissions [(Holm et al., 2012)](https://geothermal.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/Geothermal_Greenhouse_Emissions_2012_0.pdf).
These emissions can contribute to climate change if not properly managed. It is important to monitor and minimize these emissions through the implementation of advanced technologies and best practices (see section [reinjection](section:reinjection)).


### Water Pollution
Geothermal fluids can contain dissolved minerals and gases that may pose a risk to water quality if not properly managed. Some of these substances, such as hydrogen sulfide, can be toxic and harmful to the environment. To prevent water pollution, it is essential to establish appropriate fluid management practices, such as treating and reinjecting geothermal fluids back into the reservoir or disposing of them in a safe and regulated manner.

### Induced seismicity
The drilling and injection of water into geothermal reservoirs may cause small-scale earthquakes or tremors, known as induced seismicity. Although the risk of significant earthquakes is low, it is still a concern in some areas. Monitoring and managing induced seismicity are essential to ensure the safety of surrounding communities and infrastructure.

`````{admonition} During geothermal operations, several activities can potentially cause induced seismicity:
:class: tip
- Drilling: The process of drilling deep wells into the Earth's crust can sometimes cause small movements in the surrounding rock layers. These movements may result in minor tremors or vibrations.

- Fluid injection: When the cooled fluids are reinjected back into the reservoir, they can increase the pressure in the underground rock formations. This increase in pressure can cause small shifts or fractures in the rocks, which may result in tremors or earthquakes.

- Fluid extraction: Removing fluids from the reservoir can also cause changes in pressure within the rock formations. These changes may lead to the movement of rocks, which can trigger tremors or earthquakes.

It is essential to note that induced seismicity associated with geothermal operations is generally minor in scale and often goes unnoticed by people living nearby. However, monitoring and managing this phenomenon to ensure the safety of surrounding communities and infrastructure is still essential. Geothermal operators can use advanced monitoring systems and adjust their operations to minimize the risk of induced seismicity.

# Operational risks and safety measures

## Processes during production 

### Scaling
As we already said, pressure and temperature decrease as we extract geothermal fluid from the surface. This may lead to one of the major issues - scaling. As temperature drops and gases exsolve from the fluid, solubility of the minerals initially contained in the fluid also drops. It is mainly controlled by the saturation index (SI) and when SI > 0, mineral is considered over-saturated and can precipitate out of the solution. What this means to us, is that there is a risk of scaling in the production tubings, heat exchanger and other surface facilities. Scaling leads to the decreased tubes diameter and, consequently, lower productivity. It can also promote corrosion of metal surfaces and compromise the system. 

### Corrosion

One of the major reasons for corrosion is contact of the geothermal fluid with oxygen at the different stages of operation, which leads to oxidation of ions, iron in particular. It has been observed that concentration of these oxidized ions increases as fluid passes from the production to the injection site {cite}`Brehme2018`.

### Control and prevention

Various methods to control scaling and corrosion exist and are constantly being developed. One of the most common is usage of chemicals - scaling or corrosion inhibitors to prevent or, at least, slow down these processes.
Additionally, to decrease scaling, increased pressure at the surface can be applied to keep gas in the dissolved state. 
Development of chemical models to accurately predict system's behavior is another big research topic, receiving attention.

## Processes during reinjection

Reinjection of the produced geothermal fluid back into the reservoir is a common practice, widely applied at fields around the world {cite}`Kaya2011, Stefansson1997`. There is a number of reasons for using this technology {cite}`Axelsson2012, Kaya2011`:

* Produced water disposal due to environmental reasons and regulations;
* Recharge of the reservoir/aquifer;
* Pressure compensation to account for fluid extraction and to prevent subsidence;
* Enhancement of thermal extraction from over- and underlying formations.

So, geothermal fluid re-injection has clear economical and technical advantages and is a key, and sometimes mandatory, process in a geothermal project. Therefore, its efficiency is very important and possible issues are constantly monitored to prevent them. Success of this process could be influenced by various processes during operations. Disturbances in temperature, pressure, stresses and compositions in geothermal reservoirs as a result of reinjection could trigger complex coupled processes that influence injectivity. Later we discuss these processes individually in more detail.

### Cooling of the reservoir

As we said before, the water injected into the geothermal reservoir has a lower temperature than that of the reservoir itself. As a result, heat flows from the rock towards the fluid, causing the temperature of the production well water to be higher than that of the injected water. However, in a closed geothermal reservoir, the extracted heat cannot be replenished, and the total amount of heat available for extraction is finite. This can be likened to the depletion of a water tank as water is pumped out; similarly, the extraction of heat leads to a reduction in the total amount of heat available, which in turn affects the reservoir's temperature.
The reduction in temperature caused by the pumping of water has a direct impact on the productivity of the reservoir. As the temperature decreases, the economic viability of further exploitation also declines. Additionally, the temperature changes can trigger faults located in the cooling regime of the reservoir.

### Injectivity decline

One key issue that determines the success of reinjection, thus of the whole geothermal project, is to achieve and maintain injectivity at acceptable level. In many geothermal fields where reinjection has been applied, continuous decreases in injectivity have been recorded {cite}`Brehme2019, Birner2015`. In other words, as the time goes we are able to inject less and less fluid because of some blockages. In some extreme cases, poor injectivity performance has led to the shutdown of the whole geothermal project, such as the Klaipeda geothermal plant in Lithuania.

Based on the primary mechanisms, the clogging processes can be divided into three groups: a) physical processes, related to migration of particles; b) chemical processes, caused by chemical reactions; c) biological processes as a result of bacterial activity.

As you can see from the schematic, sources of clogging occur all the way along the fluid path. 
- From the start of production fluid can carry small particles, produced, for example, from poorly-consolidated sandstones. 
- As the fluid moves up, its pressure and temperature decreases, minerals saturation decreases and scaling can occur.
- After heat extraction, despite complex filtration systems, some fines are still left in the fluid volume and can migrate further into the reservoir. Corrosion also can occur at this stage if the system is not isolated.
- When the cold fluid is injected back into the reservoir, multiple processes can happen:
  - Not-filtered fines can block the pores;
  - Changes in the chemical composition can result in dissolution or precipitation of minerals in the pore space;
  - Changes in fluid salinity or pH can initiate migration of internal fines or swelling of clays;
  - Contamination of water as well as change of the temperature can promote bacterial activity, resulting in production of bio-polymers and pore space reduction.

So, you can see that at the end of this chain multiple processes can result in the reduction of rock porosity and permeability, which can seriously affect the whole process. There are various remediation methods for each of the described issues, however prediction of these processes is crucial for successul prevention.

### Thermal fracturing at the well and hydro-shearing

The injection of fluids into a reservoir can cause significant changes in temperature, which may lead to the opening or reopening of fractures. This thermal crack initiation and propagation can alter the injectivity and permeability of the well, ultimately affecting the economic viability of the reservoir. Additionally, the energy released by these thermal cracks may result in induced seismicity.
It is important to note that excessive permeability can cause the reservoir to cool too quickly, which can negatively impact its long-term profitability. On the other hand, insufficient permeability can result in poor fluid exchange, leading to suboptimal economic performance.
In crystalline reservoirs, such as granite, fluid flow occurs primarily through fractures. To improve fracture permeability, a stimulation technique involving the injection of water at high pressure is employed. This process causes the fracture to slide and dilate, thereby creating a larger flow channel and improving the flow and heat exchange in the reservoir.
