# Geothermal Energy Utilisation

## Introduction @Tristan
* From the geothermal reservoir we receive a hot fluid at the surface carrying thermal energy. But how can we use this thermal energy?
* We can use it directly to heat homes, offices and even greenhouses, or we can convert it to over forms of useful such as electricity.
* 

## Role of Geothermal Energy @Lorenzo
* depends where you are
* Iceland is driven by geothermal but in a unique position
* multipurpose tool - Munich area 

## Direct Use

### District Heating @Phil?

### Heat Pumps @Arianna?

## Energy Conversion @Tristan
* Converting one form of energy into another is associated with losses. Provide an example to build an intuition for irreversibility (e.g. fried fish) then relate back to energy conversion (i.e. easy to convert electricity to heat but reverse is difficult)
* There are different techniques for converting heat to work, such as the Carnot or Rankine cycles. The former is a very idealised while the second is more practical to execute in the real world. Geothermal power plants use variations of the Rankine Cycle

Have a separate page for the two power cycles Carnot and Rankine
### Carnot

### Rankine 

## Power Plants

### Dry Steam @Tristan
* Geofluid arrives as vapour is the easiest to handle because we can directly use it to drive a turbine
* Link back to Rankine Cycle (reservoir is heat introduction)

### Flash @Tristan
* Geofluid is a mixture of liquid and vapour
* only vapour portion can be utilised as liquid is incompressible
* flash temperature optimisation

### Binary @Lorenzo
* low temperatures/vapour content
* transfer heat to secondary fluid, which undergoes a classical rankine cycle

## Power Plant Equipment @Lorenzo

### Heat Exchanger

### Pump

### Turbine

### Generator

### Valve/Orifice
