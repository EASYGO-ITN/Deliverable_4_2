## What is geothermal energy (@ Esteban)

Geothermal energy, derived from the Greek words "geos" (Earth) and "thermos" (heat), refers to the abundant heat energy within our planet. This report explores the historical significance, energy generation process, distribution, and future prospects of geothermal energy.
Throughout history, humanity has harnessed geothermal energy in various ways. Hot springs and natural fumaroles provided sustenance, warmth, and therapeutic benefits to ancient civilizations. In 1904, the world witnessed a significant breakthrough at Larderello, Italy, where the first geothermal power plant illuminated a few light bulbs, marking a crucial milestone in the utilization of Earth's natural heat for electricity generation.



## Where is the heat from ? (@ Wen)
The fact that there is heat stored in the Earth is typically evidenced by the intrusion of magma at volcanic sites and widespread distribution of hot springs. Actually, heat flux exists on the every squar meter of the Earth surface, which on average is 87 mW/m<sup>2</sup>, with a total (integrating over the whole surface) amount of ~ 4.4 x 10<sup>13</sup> J/s {cite}`heatflux1, heatflux2`. The heat flux observed on the surface of the Earth is a result of conduction, convection and radiation from the inner part of the Earth. 

Now we know that heat flux exists across each square meter of the Earth's surface, and is attributed to various mechanisms such as conduction, convection, and radiation arising from its interior. The next question is, what is the origin of the heat? Before answering this question, it is worthwhile to introduce briefly the structure of our planet.

The Earth has four parts, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust, shown in Fig.1.
 * inner core: composed of solid iron at the temperature of around 5200 degree C,  with a radius of 1221 km;
 * outer core: composed of liquid iron and nickel at the temperature between 4500 ~ 5500 degree C, with a radius of 2200 km approimately.
 * mantle: composed of silicate minerals, oxides and other high-density minerals whose atoms are relatively small, e.g. magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al){cite}`heatflux1` at the temperature ranging from 1000 ~3700 degree C {cite}`geographic`, with a thickness of 2890 km approximately.
 * crust: consists of oceanic (thickness between 6 ~ 10 km) and continental (30 ~ 60 km) crusts. Oceanic crust is composed mostly of mafic rock like basalt troctolite and gabbro, while continental crust is composed mostly of granites {cite}`geographic`.


Knowing the Earth structure, it is time to answer the question, what is the origin of the heat stroed in the Earth.

The origin of this heat can be attributed to two sources: the residual heat from the early formation of the Earth's core and the heat generated from radioactive decay {cite}`heatflux1`. The prevailing consensus suggests that a proportion of the thermal energy harnessed through geothermal utilizations, approximately 40%, is derived from the residual heat associated with the early formation of the Earth's core, whereas the remaining 60% is sourced from the heat produced by the decay of long-lived isotopes {cite}`heatflux1`.

### Remaning heat from the early formation of the Earth (@ Wen)
Let's have a closer look on the heat arising from the early formation of the Earth's core. Approximately 4.56 billion years ago, the Earth underwent formation through the accumulation of matter from the nascent solar nebula. Dust particles, sand-sized objects, and other debris collided and  aggregated, ultimately giving rise to terrestrial-sized planets in a matter of several tens of millions of years {cite}`heatflux1`. When the planet was growing by accreting materials, the kinetic energy of incoming bodies that impacted the planetary surface was partly transformed to heat {cite}`heatflux1`. As the planet continued to expand in size, the pressures in the interior caused the compression of silicate minerals and other substances, thereby leading to a corresponding increase in the planet's internal temperature {cite}`heatflux1`. In addition, the decay of plentiful, short-lived radioactive elements that were present in the early solar nebula resulted in the heating of the adjacent environment through collisions between particles and the atoms surrounding the decaying isotopes {cite}`heatflux1`.

As a result of the above processes occuring in early life of our planet, the Earth's interior temperature rose, surpassing the melting point of iron. Then the liquid iron migrated to the center of the Earth due to higher density compared to silicates which was in contact with the iron, forming a liquid core. Heat was also produced during that migration process resulting from the release of gravitational potential energy {cite}`heatflux1`.

The amalgamation of these factors gave rise to a differentiated planet that featured a molten iron core, forming in a period of under 30 million years {cite}`core_formed`. Since then, the core has undergone gradual cooling, resulting in the establishment of a solid inner core  with a radius of 1221 km and a liquid outer core with a radius of 2200 km approimately.


### Heat from radioactive decay of long-lived isotopes (@ Wen)
Since the formation of the Earth, metal was redistributed, accompanied by density stratification. While the core is composed of iron, the mantle, which in contact with the outer core, mainly consists of silicate minerals, oxides and other high-density minerals whose atoms are relatively small, e.g. magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al){cite}`heatflux1`, resulting in low existence of radioactive elements. Directly formed from mantle (extruded magma), the oceanic crust  thus, the same with the mantle, havs a low abundance of radioactive elements {cite}`heatflux1`. In contrast, the continental crust, composed of minerals that was incompatible with the high-density minerals in the mantle, holds the largest global reservoir of radioactive elements, such as potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th). 

![Crust](../GeothermalEnergy/Origin_pictures/crust.png)

More specifically, considering the density profile of continental crust, three layers can be characterised: lower, middle and upper crust {cite}`heatflux1`, shown in Fig.2. The lower layer is mainly composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with low concentrations of radioactive elements, whereas the middle and upper crusts are more enriched in radioactive elements {cite}`heatflux1`. The heterogeneous distribution of radioactive elemtns and the largely varying thickness in the crust as a result of tectonic activity, which forms mountains and basins, result in substantial variation in heat flux on the surface {cite}`heatflux1`. Consequently, the geothermal gradient in the shallow crust can be quite unevenly.

## Where can I find it? (@Esteban)
Geothermal energy is available worldwide, but its distribution and accessibility are influenced by the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. Two primary types of geothermal energy systems exist: convection-dominated and conduction-dominated (Moeck, 2014). Convection-dominated systems occur in areas with active plate movements or volcanic activity. Hot fluids rise to the surface, creating high-temperature resources suitable for power generation. Conduction-dominated systems, found in relatively stable regions, transfer heat primarily through the ground, exhibiting lower to medium-temperature resources located at greater depths compared to convection-dominated systems. (Gianelli & Grassi, 2001; Pruess & Bodvarsson, 1983).

## Future of geothermal energy (Esteban)
The future of geothermal energy holds great promise as a key player in our pursuit of a sustainable and low-carbon future. Technological advancements and enhanced understanding of geothermal systems are driving further development and utilization of this renewable energy source.

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) show potential for expanding geothermal resources beyond naturally occurring high-temperature reservoirs (Tester et al., 2007). By creating engineered reservoirs through techniques like hydraulic fracturing, EGS can significantly increase geothermal resource availability in previously untapped areas.

Ongoing research focuses on improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of geothermal power plants. Innovations in drilling techniques, geophysical exploration methods, and heat extraction technologies aim to optimize resource utilization, reduce exploration risks, and enhance economic viability. Integration of geothermal energy with other renewables and energy storage systems further enhances its potential, providing stable baseload power and grid stability.
Governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions recognize the value of geothermal energy and are investing in its development. Supportive policies, financial incentives, and regulatory frameworks are being implemented to foster global growth in geothermal projects. Direct use applications, such as geothermal heat pumps for efficient heating and cooling solutions in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, are gaining momentum, reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuel-based systems.

In conclusion, the future of geothermal energy is bright and holds immense potential. With ongoing technological advancements, expanded resource availability through enhanced geothermal systems, and increasing recognition of its environmental and economic benefits, geothermal energy is poised to become a fundamental component of our sustainable energy mix. By harnessing the Earth's natural heat, we can pave the way for a cleaner, greener, and more resilient energy future.
