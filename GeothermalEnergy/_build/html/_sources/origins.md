# The origins of geothermal energy

## What is geothermal energy

Geothermal energy, derived from the Greek words "geos" (Earth) and "thermos" (heat), refers to the abundant thermal energy in the crust of our planet. This report explores the historical significance, energy generation process, distribution, and future prospects of geothermal energy.
Throughout history, humanity has harnessed geothermal energy in various ways. Hot springs and natural fumaroles provided sustenance, warmth, and therapeutic benefits to ancient civilizations. In 1904, the world witnessed a significant breakthrough at Larderello, Italy, where the first geothermal power plant illuminated a few light bulbs, marking a crucial milestone in the utilization of Earth's natural heat for electricity generation.


## Where is the geothermal energy from?
The intrusion of magma at volcanic sites and widespread distribution of hot springs show us there is some kind of heat just under our feet. This heat has its origin in the interior of the Earth, reaching the Earth's surface via heat conduction, convection and radiatation. But, what is the interior of the Earth?

The Earth consists of four parts, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust, shown in Fig.1.
 * **inner core**: composed of solid iron at the temperature of around 5200 &deg; C,  with a radius of 1221 km {cite}`heatflux1`;
 * **outer core**: composed of liquid iron and nickel at the temperature between 4500 &deg; C ~ 5500 &deg; C, with a radius of 2200 km approimately {cite}`heatflux1`.
 * **mantle**: composed of silicate minerals, oxides and other high-density minerals whose atoms are relatively small, e.g. magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al){cite}`heatflux1` at the temperature ranging from 1000 ~3700 &deg; C {cite}`geographic`, with a thickness of 2890 km approximately.
 * **crust**: consists of oceanic (thickness between 6 ~ 10 km) and continental (30 ~ 60 km) crusts. Oceanic crust is composed mostly of mafic rock like basalt troctolite and gabbro, while continental crust is composed mostly of granites {cite}`geographic`.

The origin of the geothermal energy can be attributed to two sources: the residual heat from the early formation of the Earth's core and the heat generated from radioactive decay {cite}`heatflux1`. The prevailing consensus suggests that a proportion of the thermal energy harnessed through geothermal utilizations, approximately 40%, is derived from the residual heat associated with the early formation of the Earth's core, whereas the remaining 60% is sourced from the heat produced by the decay of long-lived isotopes {cite}`heatflux1`.


### How the heat is generated?
Since the formation of the Earth, metal was redistributed, accompanied by density stratification. While the core is composed of iron, the mantle, which is in contact with the outer core, mainly consists of silicate minerals, oxides and other high-density minerals whose atoms are relatively small, e.g. magnesium (Mg), titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al){cite}`heatflux1`, resulting in low existence of radioactive elements. Directly formed from mantle (extruded magma), the oceanic crust  thus have a low abundance of radioactive elements {cite}`heatflux1`. In contrast, the continental crust, composed of minerals that was incompatible with the high-density minerals in the mantle, holds the largest global reservoir of radioactive elements, such as potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th).

More specifically, considering the density profile of continental crust, three layers can be characterised: lower, middle and upper crust {cite}`heatflux1`, shown in Fig.2. The lower layer is mainly composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with low concentrations of radioactive elements, whereas the middle and upper crusts are more enriched in radioactive elements {cite}`heatflux1`. The heterogeneous distribution of radioactive elemtns and the largely varying thickness in the crust result in substantial variation in heat flux on the surface {cite}`heatflux1`. Consequently, the geothermal gradient throughout the shallow crust is not uniform.

* Residual heat from the early formation of the Earth, is beleived to contribute 40% of the thermal energy harnessed through geothermal utilisation.

* Heat from radioactive decay of long-lived isotopes, such as potassium (K), uranium (U) and thorium (Th) that exist in the continental crust, accounts for 60% around of the thermal energy harnessed through geothermal utilization.

## Where can we find it?

The availability of geothermal energy is influenced by the movement of Earth's tectonic plates, which affects its distribution and accessibility. While geothermal energy exists worldwide, certain areas possess greater potential and ease of extraction. The movement of tectonic plates plays a significant role in determining the type of geothermal energy found in a particular region {cite}`moeck `. These plates control crucial factors such as heat distribution, water flow, and the presence of faults and fractures in the Earth's crust. Understanding these factors is key to comprehending the functioning of geothermal energy.

There are two primary types of geothermal energy systems: convection-dominated and conduction-dominated {cite}`moeck `. Convection-dominated systems are prevalent in areas characterized by active plate movements or volcanic activity. In these systems, hot fluids rise to the surface, carrying heat from deep within the Earth. This results in high-temperature resources suitable for power generation. The flow of these fluids is influenced by the geological structures present in the area.

Conversely, conduction-dominated systems occur in regions where tectonic plates are relatively stable, with little recent volcanic activity. In such systems, heat is transferred through the ground primarily by conduction, while the movement of fluids is limited. Conduction-dominated systems, found in relatively stable regions, transfer heat primarily through the ground, exhibiting lower to medium-temperature resources located at greater depths compared to convection-dominated systems {cite}`gianelli, pruess `

Determining the potential and characteristics of geothermal energy in a specific area requires thorough geological studies and assessments. Factors such as plate movements, volcanic activity, and subsurface structures play vital roles in understanding the feasibility and effectiveness of harnessing geothermal energy. By exploring and understanding the geothermal potential of different regions, we can strategically utilize this renewable energy source to contribute to sustainable power generation and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

## Future of geothermal energy
The future of geothermal energy holds great promise as a key player in our pursuit of a sustainable and low-carbon future. Technological advancements and enhanced understanding of geothermal systems are driving further development and utilization of this renewable energy source.

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) show potential for expanding geothermal resources beyond naturally occurring high-temperature reservoirs {cite}`tester`. By creating engineered reservoirs through techniques like hydraulic fracturing, EGS can significantly increase geothermal resource availability in previously untapped areas.

Ongoing research focuses on improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of geothermal power plants. Innovations in drilling techniques, geophysical exploration methods, and heat extraction technologies aim to optimize resource utilization, reduce exploration risks, and enhance economic viability. Integration of geothermal energy with other renewables and energy storage systems further enhances its potential, providing stable baseload power and grid stability.
Governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions recognize the value of geothermal energy and are investing in its development. Supportive policies, financial incentives, and regulatory frameworks are being implemented to foster global growth in geothermal projects. Direct use applications, such as geothermal heat pumps for efficient heating and cooling solutions in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, are gaining momentum, reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuel-based systems.

In conclusion, the future of geothermal energy is bright and holds immense potential. With ongoing technological advancements, expanded resource availability through enhanced geothermal systems, and increasing recognition of its environmental and economic benefits, geothermal energy is poised to become a fundamental component of our sustainable energy mix. By harnessing the Earth's natural heat, we can pave the way for a cleaner, greener, and more resilient energy future.
