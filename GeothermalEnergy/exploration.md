# Exploration of Geothermal Resources

This chapter is about the exploration and evaluation of geothermal resources

 ## Explain what is Exploration 
 - Targets 
 - What do we use to explore (prior geologic knowledge) 
 which then ties in to "how"
 
 ## How we explore 
 ### Exploratory well drilling 
- Image of core logs (Bedretto core logs)
- Paragraph of different type of well data 
 ### Geophysics
 - Make analog to medical x-rays
 - Talk about acquisition (include pictures)
 #### Seismic
 - Explain the method and make a gif with wave propagation 
 #### Multi-physics (EM, gravity, magnetics)
 - Explain the method and make a gif with wave propagation 
 - Add gravity circle interactive thingy
 
## Modelling
 ### Geologic model 
 - Look for gempy model of utah forge existing site (granite wih some sedimentary layers on top)
 ### Inversion 
- Forward and backward simulation (seismogram and gempy model connected with loopy thingy)
- Resulting model that is given to reservoir modelers (production link)
